TidyDataProject
===============

This repo contains the source code, data, and documentation for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The script assumes that the zipped file for the assignment has been unzipped in the same directory as the run_analysis.R file.

The script reads the two "X" files in the UCI HAR Dataset folder and combines them into a single dplyr data frame.
